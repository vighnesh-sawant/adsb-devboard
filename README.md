# adsb-devboard
A devboard with an fpga  and an ADS-B reciever

# Why
When I was younger, I always wanted to tinker with radio stuff. When I learned airplanes broadcast  
all of their info on rf just like that, I tried naievly to process that using my phone thinking it had a rf reciever so it probably can.  
As it turns out it can't/ or is locked down so it can't.
So on learning about blueprint, I made by childhood dream come true!

# How
Get a pcb and a antenna, keep it in an open area, then flashing my firmware (not complete yet) should get you data about a good amount of flights in the vicinity  
(according to my research 50km ish)
